- Minimum bond amount: 500 PEO
- Cryptographic identity verification
- Deterministic subnet assignment

### 2.2 Performance Tracking
- Consensus-only metrics calculation
- No subjective scoring mechanisms
- Transparent, verifiable performance evaluation

### 2.3 Security Constraints
- Threshold signature key rotation
- Zero-knowledge subnet attestation
- Provable slashing conditions

## 3. System Components

### 3.1 Backend Services
