# ADR 001: Validator Bond Non-Custodial Architecture

## Status
- Proposed
- Date: 2025-05-12
- Deciders: Daniil Krizhanovskyi, Dan Otieno

## Context
[Describe the architectural context that necessitates this decision]
The PeoChain network requires a secure and decentralized mechanism for validator participation that ensures validators maintain control of their bonds while providing necessary security guarantees to the network.

## Decision
We will implement a non-custodial architecture for validator bonds using:
- Threshold signature schemes for distributed key management
- Smart contracts for automated bond management
- Zero-knowledge proofs for validator attestation
- Deterministic subnet assignment based on verifiable random functions

## Consequences
### Positive
- Enhanced security through distributed key management
- True non-custodial control of validator bonds
- Reduced centralization risks
- Transparent and verifiable validator operations

### Negative
- Increased protocol complexity
- Higher computational overhead for cryptographic operations
- More complex recovery procedures

### Neutral
- Requires validators to maintain more sophisticated key management systems
- Changes to traditional validator operations workflow

## Alternatives Considered
1. Traditional custodial bonding with multisig controls
2. Pure smart contract-based bonding without threshold signatures
3. Hybrid approach with optional custody delegation
